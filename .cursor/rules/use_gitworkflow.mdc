This project uses GitWorkflow for all git operations.

1) Git Operations:
  - ALWAYS use `.git_workflow/git_workflow.ps1` for ANY git operations
  - NEVER use raw git commands unless explicitly approved by human
  - If operation not supported by GitWorkflow:
	a) STOP - do not use raw git commands
	b) Report to user: "Human, operation X is not defined in GitWorkflow. Should we add it officially?"
	c) Only proceed with raw git if explicitly approved

2) Repository Operations:
  - Check for updates before operations: `.git_workflow/git_workflow.ps1`
  - Follow security warnings if shown
  - Use standard commit message format
  - Always include issue references if applicable

3) Issue Management:
  - Use GitWorkflow's issue creation system
  - Follow standard labeling conventions
  - Use proper issue templates
  - Link commits to issues when resolving

4) Security:
  - Review security warnings during updates
  - Never bypass security checks without user approval
  - Report suspicious changes to repository owner
