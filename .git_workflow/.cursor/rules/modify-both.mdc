# Dual Update Responsibility

When modifying this project, remember it has two roles:
1. As a standalone tool (GitWorkflow repository itself)
2. As a submodule in other projects

Therefore, every change must:
1. Update the tool's own functionality (in this repository)
2. Ensure compatibility with projects using it as a submodule
3. Test both aspects before committing changes

Example:
- When adding a new feature: Add the feature code AND update submodule integration instructions
- When changing existing feature: Update the code AND ensure all submodule references still work


- When updating documentation: Cover both standalone usage AND submodule usage
